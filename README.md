### Welcome!

Since I was a child, I have been passionate about technology. 
I had my first contact with a computer in the distant Windows 95, with dial-up internet, where you expected horrors to load a simple web page. 
However, even though it crossed my mind, I never thought about pursuing a career in programming, until recently.

As a self-taught person, I recently started studying programming on my own because I didn't see myself doing any other profession. 
And here I am, still at the beginning, knowing almost nothing, but with a dream in mind: to become a front-end developer!

_Thanks for visiting my profile, see you later! =)_
